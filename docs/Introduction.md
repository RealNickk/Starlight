# Introduction

## Why Starlight?
Starlight is cool and all, but why should you use it? Can't I use the regular Roblox launcher? Here are some reasons Starlight is superior:
- When using Starlight, Roblox won't nag (or even force) you into using their beta UWP application.
- Starlight is lightweight compared to Roblox's native launcher. It doesn't make pesky requests to Roblox's ephermeral API, and it gives you the option to spoof your browser tracker, meaning that you may be able to bypass certain anti-cheat measures.
- Starlight can unlock your FPS, set a static resolution, make your client headless, set a custom Roblox version, launch games from the command line, and more. It's a very powerful tool for a tinkerer.
- It's a collection of tools that you can use to do whatever you want with Roblox, other than exploiting. It's not a Roblox exploit, but it can be used with Roblox exploits.
- Starlight is open source, so you can see exactly what it's doing if you're skeptical. You can also contribute to the project if you want, so it's a win for everyone.
- Starlight is being actively developed, and is constantly being updated with new features. It's not just a one-time thing.
