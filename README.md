## Disclaimers

Licenses provided with other software that modify Roblox—Synapse X, Script-Ware, etc.—may be compatible with Starlight. However, their licenses may not allow third party tools to modify Roblox along with their software.

Roblox's terms of service states that reverse engineering software provided by Roblox and the attempt to bypass security measures put in place by Roblox violates their terms of service. When using Starlight, you are virtually breaking Roblox's rules.

Starlight supports user-made plugins to improve the software without having to contribute to the repository. Plugins not released under Substrant are not maintained by Substrant and may me malicious. It is your responsibility as a client to ensure that a plugin is safe—which does **NOT** mean to scan it with an antivirus. Ensure that the source of a plugin is safe with software like dotPeek or dnSpy, as plugins have the ability to execute arbitrary code.
